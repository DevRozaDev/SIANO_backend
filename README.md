## Summary
The server code of a mobile application that allows for an easy splitting of group expenses.\
Designed and implemented as part of the Group Project course in Poznan University of Technology.\
Back when we developed it such services weren't commonplace yet.\
Main features of the mobile application:
- account creation (+authorization)
- resetting password via email (using the `bamboo` library)
- tracking of group expenses
- consolidation of expenses between several virtual receipts for a given group
